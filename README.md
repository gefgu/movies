A project to "imitate" IMDb. It features the most popular movies right now, the top rated movies, and the latest movies rated by users on the site. Besides, it features exclusive pages for each film, with photos, videos and trailers, as well as exclusive pages for actors and actresses. The user can also rate a movie through an authentication system using Firebase to store the user's data and their rating of the movies.
